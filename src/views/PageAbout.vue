    <span class="title">A word about this blog üìÑ</span>
    <p>
      This blog is primarily being build by me to practice and learn
      more about Vue.js and deepen my knowledge in
      CSS and HTML. I'm also documenting the development in my
      <a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@paulossr">medium</a> profile.
    </p>

    <span class="title">And about me üßëüèª‚Äçüíª</span>

    <p>I've been working with front-end development since 2018 and have worked with:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>ReactJS</li>
      <li>React Native</li>
      <li>Vue.js</li>
    </ul>

    <span>But I love to write some code in:</span>

    <ul>
      <li>iOS (Swift)</li>
      <li>NodeJS</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I'm really trying to apply TDD in all places when its reasonable,
      currently in Vue.js components. The reason is that, for me, it gives me more 
      confidence on shipping my code. I can also add other benefits such as that tests gives
      a documentation on how the software should work, they make refactoring a breeze and 
      you can actualy develop faster, of course, after lots and lots of practice
      <strong>(I'm currently here)</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also love to study about software architecture, draw diagrams of dependencies and make 
      the code as decoupled as possible while also not making it to maintain or change
      as it should be <strong><i>soft</i></strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have a personal preference for statically typed
      languages (like <strong>Typescript and Swift</strong>) but most of my development 
      time has been on <strong>Javascript</strong>.
